## Tech Stack

-   React.js (functional components, hooks)
-   Supabase (backend as a service)
-   Tailwind CSS (styling)
-   React Router v6+ (familiar with actions, used for navigation)
-   React Hook Form (form handling)
-   React Query (data fetching)

## Note

This project is provided for **code review purposes only**.
The backend (Supabase) may not be running constantly, so it is **not intended to be run locally**.
The focus is on reviewing the React code, structure, and implementation of concepts.
If requested, I can demonstrate the working application during an interview.
